# Odoo Development Universal Skill

A universal Odoo development skill for AI agents compatible with `skills.sh`. It
provides fast code indexing, intelligent patterns, and strict adherence to Odoo
Community Association (OCA) standards for versions 14 to 19.

This repository is a fork and adaptation of the Odoo plugin from
[letzdoo/claude-marketplace](https://github.com/letzdoo/claude-marketplace),
restructured to be 100% agnostic and compatible with any IDE that supports `skills.sh`
(like Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, etc.).

## 🌟 Features

- **Version Awareness**: Covers Odoo 14 to 19, including breaking changes and deprecated
  methods.
- **OCA Standards Strict Adherence**: Enforces PEP8, DRY, KISS, and SOLID principles.
- **OWL Compatibility**: Knowledge of OWL 1.x (v15), 2.x (v16-18), and 3.x (v19).
- **Specialized Agents**: Includes 4 workflows (agents) for Context Gathering, Code
  Review, Upgrade Analysis, and Skill Discovery.
- **123 Skill Patterns**: Detailed copy-paste ready code snippets for every functional
  domain in Odoo.

## 🛠️ Usage

Once installed, your AI assistant will automatically read `SKILL.md` when Odoo-related
tasks are requested. The assistant will:

1. Detect your Odoo version automatically.
2. Check existing Enterprise or Community modules before reinventing the wheel.
3. Fetch the exact pattern needed from the `skills/` folder.
4. Implement the solution adhering to OCA guidelines.
